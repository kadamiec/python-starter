# Python Starter Kit

This is a simle starter-kit repo promoting some good-practices for python project organization combining Jupyter Notebooks with unit tests and venv

* Start with VS Code with `Python: Create Virtual Environment` and select `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` to install deps
* Play with `SANDBOX` yupyter notebook
* Put your logic in classes in `my_lib` or creat new one from scratch
* Write unit-tests in `test/` directory and run them with `pytest -v` for verbose

## Alternative
### pipenv
`pipenv` will install Pipenv file and configure runtime/virtual env without needing for `requirement*.txt` file
